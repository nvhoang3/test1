## 1. Intro to Computer Network

**Computer Network** is a _set of computers_ sharing resources located on or provided by _network nodes_.
The computers use common communication protocols over digital interconnections to communicate with each other.
The nodes of a computer network may include personal computers, servers, networking hardware, or other specialised or general-purpose hosts which are identified by hostnames and network addresses.
While hostnames serve as memorable labels for the nodes, network addresses serve for locating and identifying the nodes by communication protocols such as the Internet Protocol (IP).
A communication protocol is a system of rules that allows two or more entities of a communications system to transmit information via any kind of variation of a physical quantity.
The protocol defines the rules, syntax, semantics and synchronization of communication and possible error recovery methods.
Protocols may be implemented by hardware, software, or a combination of both.

Various communication services and applications are provided by the use of computer network, such as video conferencing, email, online chat, www, digital media as well as resources/data sharing, etc.

Different types of networks can be classified on basis of geographic scale.
Listed are some of computer network categories usually used:

- **Personal Area Network (PAN)** is the smallest and the most basic type of network. A PAN is usually made up of a wireless modem, one or several computers, phones, tablets, etc., and ***resolves around one person in one building***. This type of network is typically found in small offices or residences, managed by one person or organization from a single device.
- **Local Area Network (LAN)** is one of the most common and simple type of network. LANs connects groups of computers and devices together across ***short distances***, for example within a building or a group of two, three buildings in close proximity, in order to share information and resources. Enterprises typically manage and maintain LANs.
- **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)** is a type of network which is larger than LAN but smaller than WAN, incorporating elements from both types of networks. MANs span an ***entire geographic area*** (typically a town or city). Ownership and maintenance is handled by either a singal person or company.
- **Wide Area Network (WAN)** connects computers together ***across longer physical distances***, allowing computers and devices to be ***remotely interconnected over one large network***. The Internet is the most basic example of WAN, connecting all computers together around the globe. Due to WAN's vast reach, it is maintained by multiple administrators or the public over one large network.

## 2. Conceptual Models of Computer Network

### 2.1. OSI Model

**Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model** is a conceptual, reference model used to describe the functions of a networking system.
The OSI model characterizes computing functions into a universal set of rules and requirements in order o support interoperability between different products and software.
In the OSI reference model, the communications between a computing system are split into seven different abstraction lers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.
